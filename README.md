# eco-roster

Creating a complete Python program for an "eco-roster" project involves several components, including data handling, machine learning model building, optimization, and error handling. This is a simplified illustration of how you might structure such a program. The program will follow these steps:

1. Load and preprocess data.
2. Implement a simple machine learning algorithm for demand prediction.
3. Generate a roster that minimizes carbon footprint and operational cost.
4. Incorporate error handling and comments for clarity.

This example will use hypothetical data, and the logic will be simplified. You can replace this with actual datasets and more sophisticated models as needed.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import logging

# Setup basic logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Hypothetical data loading function (replace with actual data loading)
def load_data():
    try:
        # Example data: features are hours and day type (weekday/weekend), target is workforce demand
        data = pd.DataFrame({
            'hour': np.tile(np.arange(24), 14),  # 2 weeks of hourly data
            'day_type': np.repeat(['weekday', 'weekend'], 24 * 7),
            'demand': np.random.randint(50, 100, size=24*14)  # random example demand data
        })
        logging.info("Data loaded successfully.")
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error loading data: {e}")
        raise

def preprocess_data(data):
    try:
        # Convert categorical day_type to numeric
        data['day_type'] = data['day_type'].map({'weekday': 0, 'weekend': 1})
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error preprocessing data: {e}")
        raise

def train_model(data):
    try:
        # Split the data
        X = data[['hour', 'day_type']]  # Features
        y = data['demand']  # Target

        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

        # Train a simple linear regression model
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)

        # Evaluate the model
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
        logging.info(f"Model trained successfully with MSE: {mse}")

        return model
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error training model: {e}")
        raise

def optimize_roster(model, hours=24):
    try:
        # Hypothetical optimization function (replace with an actual optimization algorithm)
        # Forecast demand
        forecast_data = pd.DataFrame({
            'hour': np.arange(hours),
            'day_type': np.zeros(hours)  # assuming all weekdays for simplicity
        })
        demand_predictions = model.predict(forecast_data)

        # Generate roster (simple greedy solution; replace with advanced method)
        workforce_allocation = np.ceil(demand_predictions / 10)  # Assume one worker handles 10 units
        logging.info("Roster optimized successfully.")
        return workforce_allocation
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error optimizing roster: {e}")
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        data = load_data()
        preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)
        model = train_model(preprocessed_data)
        roster = optimize_roster(model)
        print("Optimized Workforce Allocation:", roster)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred in the main execution: {e}")
```

### Key Points:

- **Data Handling**: We use mock data for this example. You should replace this with actual workforce and demand data.
- **Error Handling**: Error logging is included to capture issues at different stages.
- **Modeling**: A simple linear regression model predicts workforce demand. You can expand this with more advanced algorithms.
- **Optimization**: This basic example divides predicted demand by an assumed worker capacity to allocate the workforce. Replace this with a more sophisticated optimization algorithm tailored to your needs.

Make sure to tailor the solution further by integrating real-world data and refining the algorithms for better performance and accuracy in your eco-roster application.
